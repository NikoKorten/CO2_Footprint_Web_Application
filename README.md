# CO²-Footprint Web Application (EcoTally)

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a web application designed to increase the transparency of CO² emissions of companies and countries. The project was implemented as part of my software development studies at the IU International University. The publication of the source code is only for the purpose of grading my work. 

## Project Structure

- **home.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure of the web page, followed by the **contact.html**, **insights.html** and **policy.html** file for the used subfiles of the project.
- **ecotally.css**: CSS file built with the Bootstrap framework to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **ecotally.js**: JavaScript file handling the (fictional) CO² emissions data, including sorting and filtering functionalities.
- **images**: Directory holding the logo and other images/graphics used in the project.

## Features

- **Responsiveness**: The webpage is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on various devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **CO² Emissions Table**: A table displays fictional CO² emissions data, sortable and filterable by country and company.

- **Code Security**: Input fields are secured to prevent code injection, ensuring the safety and integrity of the web application.
